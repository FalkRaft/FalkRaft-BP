NOTE: It is still currently in development - alpha. Do not distribute it to other users (except Thomas, Jasper, your other devices and your friends who you have very good trust with in Minecraft technicals). Some things may break if not used properly and you may get content logs.

# Functions:
• load:
    - runs the following function files:
        • anticheat
        • optimizations
• anticheat:
    - clears the players illegal items without the tag ‘admin’.
    - items are: command blocks, command block minecarts, 	structure blocks and structure voids, border blocks, and jigsaw 	blocks.
• optimizations:
    - gives every player with the tag ‘hub’ invisibility to make it easier 	on the graphics card/processor.
    - gives every player without the tag ‘survworld’ (survival world) 	night vision to avoid lightning recalculation.
• kits:
    - all of the kits for fighting.
    - the ones with 'Self' in the name, execpt for the 'clearKit', because it works on both NPCs and players, only works on the players - ones without 'Self' in their name      only work for NPCs.

# Ones in development:
• script files (in JavaScript) for the behaviours that function files can’t.

# Changelog
# v0.5.1
 • Added the script to function properly.
 • Made the script run the necessary function files.
 • Added a fly check. (In Development)

The other function files that are not listed here are the kits functions for PvP, and the FalkRaft ‘help’ command (in development).
Fell free to test the behaviour pack and/or use the function files for your worlds.
If you have a problem with the manifest.json file that is about UUIDs, then you may change them. You can generate one by going to this link: https://www.uuidgenerator.net
